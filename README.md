# ANN Number Classifier  

This repo is to track my progress in learning about machine learning.  
***  
These files are different implementations/ways to tackle the MNIST dataset with Neural networks.
***  
* __NN.py__ is a manual implementation of a deep NN using pandas and Numpy
* __tfmain.py__ is a reimplementation of NN.py using low level tensorflow
***  
Next steps:
* Convolutional NN implementation  
* Higher level TF library implementation (why are there 10 of them?)
