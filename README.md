# ANN Number Classifier  

This repo is to track my progress in learning about machine learning.  
***  
These files are different implementations/ways to tackle the MNIST dataset with Neural networks.
***  
* __LowlevelNumpy__ is a manual implementation of a deep NN using pandas and Numpy
* __LowlevelTF__ is a reimplementation of LowlevelNumpy using low level tensorflow
***  
Next steps:
* Convolutional NN implementation  
* Higher level TF library implementation (why are there 10 of them?)
